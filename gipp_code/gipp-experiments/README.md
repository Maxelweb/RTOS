# Automation The GIPP Experiments

This is a small collection of scripts to automate generating calls to the GIPP module (ecrts20) of the `sched-experiments` library (which in turns automates the use of the `schedcat` library). The high-level view of the call chain is as follows:

* `generate_experiment_calls.sh` generates a shell script to automate calls to `run_experiments.py`.
* `run_experiments.py` calls into `sched-experiments/exp/ecrts20.py`
* `sched-experiments/exp/ecrts20.py` calls into `schedcat/schedcat/locking/bounds.py`.
* `schedcat/schedcat/locking/bounds.py` calls into `schedcat/native/src/blocking/linprog/lp_gipp.cpp` via SWIG.

## High-Level Overview of What Each (Important) File Does

* `run_experiments.py` accepts a number of command line arguments, which it then uses to call into `sched-experiments`. `sched-experiments` then calls into `schedcat` to begin the execution of the Linear Programs the experiments are formulated as. The outputs of the experiments are written into CSV files.
* `generate_experiment_calls.sh` uses a number of parameters (defined in the file) to generate calls to `run_experiments.py`. The output is a shell script that invokes calls to `run_experiments.py` and puts each such call in the background. This is useful as its then "easier" to run experiments in parallel - each call occupies a thread/processor.
* `product_plots.py` takes the CSV files generated by `run_experiments.py` and generates plots (PDF format) with the use of `matplotlib`.
* `pdf_latex_template.tex` is a small template that `product_plots.py` can use (via the toggling of a flag in the file) to create the tex code for all generated plots.
